      <p>In the fall of 2011, I began pursuing this degree at the University of Nebraska at Kearney's College of
        Education as a way for me to transition from traditional classroom-based learning to more self-driven,
        project-based experiential learning. This program is designed as a supplemental degree for educators in
        Nebraska and the surrounding area, and is therefore largely online-based, with very few face-to-face courses.</p>
      <p>I chose to use this to my advantage by approaching faculty from other departments on campus and working
        closely with them to explore our mutual curiosities within their disciplinary context. The following is a list
        of my academic wanderings, organized by semester.</p>

            <h4>ART 846 - Seminar in Art Education</h4>

            <p>In collaboration with UNK Art Education professor Dr. Stephanie Baer, I spent this semester focussing on
              the use of low-cost, open-source, DIY assistive technology in classroom environments. I became very
              interested in the possibility of applying new open-source methodologies to existing problems in art
              education for students with diverse needs. Specifically, how small-run, DIY-level OSHW can make helpful
              assistive devices available to a individuals who cannot afford commercial alternatives.</p>
            <p>This semester gave me the opportunity to pursue two interesting projects; an updated version of an
              open-source eye-tracking system called Eyewriter 2.1, and a cheap, simple "sip and puff" interface that
              can be reconfigured with minimal fuss.</p>

                target="_blank">John Stanko</a> to explore the integration of 3D scanning and 3D printing into his

            <p>Working with UNK's Sculpture professor, Chad Fonfara, I pursued a series of projects in this course to
              explore the application of 3D printing within traditional mold-making and casting processes.</p>
            <p>Over the course of the semester I developed a set of parametric scripts to generate 3D-printable
              open-face and two-part molds from 3D models, which were all released on Thingiverse for free. I
              documented many experiments with casting mediums and techniques with these molds, including foods, wax,
              resin, silicone and lost ABS.</p>

            <h4>ART 853C - Printmaking</h4>

            <p>The tools of art are changing, even in traditional contexts. Increasingly, the usage of CNC milling
              machines, laser cutters and 3D printers is becoming more and more commonplace, but there are still some
              pretty substantial barriers to entry. With the exception of 3D printers, costs for these machines is
              still prohibitive for most, especially if they are not completely sure they want or need such a machine.</p>
            <p>This project was about exploring the costs and feasibility of a low-cost, hand-made CNC milling machine
              (hint: it's cheap, but difficult). This semester ended up being all about research and design, with lack
              of funding prohibiting any building.</p>

              simple Processing sketch that renders random iterations of the Superformula in 2D SVG format, I was able
              to give my wall plotter something worthy to do with it's time. </p>

            <h4>Space-themed kiosk application for Multimedia Development course</h4>

            <p>A design and development exercise in creating a simple touch-screen kiosk interface to introduce
              children to general information about space and NASA through playful interaction. Uses Flash and AS3 to
              achieve a highly interactive and engaging experience with a variety of audio-visual elements.</p>

    <div class="degree__body">
      <p>As an undergraduate at the University of Nebraska at Kearney I majored in Applied Computer Science and minored
        in Physics, with the intent of exploring advanced uses of technology, particularly in electronics and
        programming. Though my formal academic experience was not quite what I was hoping for, I was able to pursue my
        interests in the form of indepedent studies and extracurricular hobbies.</p>
      <p>Eventually, in the summer of 2010 I applied for and received a $25,000 grant offered by the University of
        Nebraska Foundation, enabling me to spend my final year as an undergraduate primarily focused on exploring
        these independant studies and interests. Thanks to the work I was able to pursue during this time I developed a
        deeper personal motivation to learn new skills and constantly experiment, a motivation that has been growing
        ever since.</p>

            <p>As the direct result of being awarded the 2010 Kelly Grant, I generated curriculum in the fall of 2010
              to introduce undergraduate students to physical computing, interactive art and creative coding through
              the Arduino and Processing frameworks. A course was offered to students in the Spring semester, which I
              was given the opportunity to teach personally - an opportunity for which I am thankful for to this day.</p>

            <h4>Organized 2011 Interactive and Generative Art Exhibition</h4>

            <p>To celebrate student work generated during the 2011 Interactive and Generative Art course I taught, I
              reserved UNK's primary event location, the Ponderosa Room in the Nebraskan Student Union, and let the
              students set up their own work for the public to view. I designed flyers and posted them around campus
              and around town, inviting anyone and everyone to come and see what these students had created.</p>

            <h4>Multi-touch surface for UNK's Computer Science Department</h4>

            <p>Excited by the wave of new DIY multi-touch surface technology at the time, I set out to design and build
              my very own using advice and techniques pioneered by the community over at <a href="http://nuigroup.com"
                target="_blank">NUI Group</a>. Originally I built a surface built on the FTIR technique designed by <a
                href="http://cs.nyu.edu/~jhan/ftirtouch/" target="_blank">Jeff Han</a>, but did not succeed. Learning
              from this experience, I built an entirely new surface from scratch using lasers and a more modern frame.</p>

            <p>Debuted at the 2011 Interactive and Generative Art Exhibition, this system utilized a projector, an
              IR-enabled webcam and a couple of infrared LEDs embedded into ping pong balls on wriststraps to allow any
              passer-by (even young children) to play a quick, fun game of pong. In collaboration with <a href="http://jeffsylvester.com/"
                target="_blank">Jeff Sylvester</a>, the system uses openFrameworks and computer vision to move the
              paddles on the screen based on what the webcam sees in real-time.</p>

            <p>Another early exploration of the Arduino platform, this project allows users to control the color of an
              RGB LED based on the presence of various passive RFID tags. This was more of a demonstration of one
              possible use of RFID technology for the faculty in my department, but it is nonetheless a project I am
              proud of.</p>

            <h4>DIY capacitive touch input device using aluminum foil, cardboard and paper</h4>

            <p>One of my first ever projects with the Arduino platform, these sensors rely on simple found materials to
              instantiate physical shortcuts to virtual activity on a PC. Using capacitive sensing technology, these
              sensors detect human touch and launch programs on a client computer using some helpfer software. The
              cardboard adds a nicely tactile 'squishy' feeling, giving a very sastifying physical response!</p>
