  <h1 class="title">Creative technologist + specialty fabricator + UI developer focused on unconventional applications
    of advanced and emerging technologies in creative contexts.</h1>

  <p>I am a chronically curious person with deep passions for creative and scientific inquiry, the natural world, and
    the mindful application of advanced technologies.</p>
  <p>I am always seeking opportunities to imagine, design, and build interesting and engaging projects for meaningful
    reasons. I especially enjoy helping other creative professionals realize ambitious, innovative projects integrating
    art and technology.</p>

  <p>My specialties and areas of research include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Digital fabrication (<a href="/tag/3d-printing">3D printing</a>, <a href="/tag/cnc">CNC</a>, and more), using
      both conventional and experimental methods.</li>
    <li>Custom <a href="/category/electronics">electronics</a> design and prototyping using Arduino and Eagle.</li>
    <li>Computational design using parametric CAD and custom code, particularly focused on the exploration and
      application of natural processes and forms.</li>
    <li>Interactive <a href="/tag/creative">installations</a>, experiences, and exhibits using all of the above.</li>
  </ul>
