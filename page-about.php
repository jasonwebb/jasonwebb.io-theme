  <p>Jason is a creative technologist based in Minneapolis, MN who continually explores the boundaries and intersections of creativity, technology, fabrication, science, and the natural world through experimental project-based work.</p>
  <p>In his personal research he is particularly focused on the exploration and application of biological processes relating to form using computational design, digital fabrication, and electronics.</p>
  <p>Professionally he leverages these passions as a UI developer specializing in cross-disciplinary collaboration between design and technical teams, realizing modern and clean experiences for all kinds of users.</p>
  <p>These interests have afforded him a few interesting opportunities over the years, including:</p>
